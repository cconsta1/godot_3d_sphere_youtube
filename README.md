# godot_3d_sphere_youtube

A small Godot 4.4.1 demo project showing how to:
- Create a 3D sphere (MeshInstance3D)
- Apply PBR textures (albedo, normal, roughness, AO, height)
- Rotate the sphere with a simple GDScript
- Add a pulsation effect with a custom ShaderMaterial

This repo accompanies my YouTube tutorial:

## Project description
This project was made as part of my learning process in Godot. It demonstrates how to set up a scene with lights and camera, apply free CC0 textures from [3DTextures.me](https://3dtextures.me/2022/01/09/marble-grey-002/), and animate a mesh both through scripting and shaders. It’s meant as a beginner-friendly walkthrough for anyone interested in real-time 3D graphics, shaders, and Godot.

## How to run
1. Clone this repo or download the ZIP.  
2. Open `project.godot` in Godot 4.4.1 (or later).  
3. Open the scene `sphere_3d.tscn`.  
4. Run the scene.
